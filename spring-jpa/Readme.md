# Why use JPA (Java Persistence Api)?
- With JDBC or Spring JDBC, we need to extract data from tables using queries and, map extracted data to Object beans using row mappers or BeanPropertyRowMapper.
- Queries can become complex in large applications.
- JPA eases the process by mapping object beans (also called entities) to tables (relations) in database.
- JPA writes queries on behalf of developer.
- JPA is an interface. Hibernate implements JPA.
- Hibernate existed before JPA. Hibernate is a popular ORM framework.
- JPA came in later after seeing sucess of Hibernate.
- ORM framework maps object to a table (or relation) in database.
- Hibernate has lot more functions than what JPA specifies.
- We can use other ORM frameworks with JPA as well.
